# ECHELON Project - Historical Background

**English** | [Magyar]

[[_TOC_]]

## Pre-War Context: RobCo Dominance

### RobCo UOS Market Penetration (2075-2077)
RobCo Industries' [Unified Operating System][UOS] achieved near-total market saturation by 2075, controlling:

#### Military Infrastructure:

* 87% of US military base terminals
* All Automated Defense Network nodes
* DEFCON monitoring stations
* Nuclear silo command systems
* Strategic Air Command facilities

#### Government Facilities:

* Federal building security systems
* Vault-Tec vault control terminals
* Research laboratory networks
* Classified data archives
* Presidential bunker systems

#### Critical Infrastructure:

* Power plant control systems (Poseidon Energy partnerships)
* Water treatment facilities
* Communications relay stations
* Transportation hubs
* Emergency broadcast systems

### The Enclave's Vulnerability

By 2076, Enclave intelligence analysts at NEST (National Emergency Strategic Terminal) identified a critical national security threat:

#### Strategic Concerns:

1. **Single Point of Failure:** RobCo's monopoly meant one compromised system could cascade through the entire network
1. **Corporate Loyalty:** Robert House's increasing autonomy raised questions about government control
1. **Chinese Intelligence:** Reports of PLA cyber warfare units specifically targeting RobCo UOS vulnerabilities
1. **Post-War Scenario:** In continuity-of-government planning, access to pre-war infrastructure was paramount

### The Critical Incident - February 2076:
A classified NSA intercept revealed Chinese operatives had successfully penetrated three military research facilities using exploited RobCo terminal weaknesses. The breach went undetected for 73 days.

#### Joint Chiefs Memo (CLASSIFIED):

> "We have built our entire defense apparatus on a commercial operating system designed for peacetime efficiency, not wartime security. If we cannot guarantee access to our own systems post-nuclear exchange, continuity of government becomes impossible."

## Project ECHELON Genesis

### Initial Authorization (March 2076)
#### Presidential Finding 76-14 (OMEGA Classification):

* Authorized development of "defensive counter-intrusion capabilities"
* Budget: $47 million (off-books, diverted from Vault-Tec contracts)
* Primary Contractor: Enclave SIGINT Division
* Cover Designation: "Terminal Maintenance Protocol Enhancement"

#### Development Team Assembly
* **Location:** Site-R (Raven Rock Mountain Complex), Sub-Level 7
* **Project Lead:** Dr. Elizabeth Krane (former RobCo engineer, recruited 2075)
* **Team Size:** 23 specialists
* **Security Clearance:** OMEGA-7 (eyes-only compartmentalized)

#### Team Composition:

* 8 cryptographers (NSA transferees)
* 6 systems engineers (military intelligence)
* 4 behavioral psychologists (for social engineering modules)
* 3 hardware specialists (for Pip-Boy integration)
* 2 legal advisors (for plausible deniability frameworks)

#### Development Philosophy
Dr. Krane's approach was controversial within the Enclave:

##### The "Know Your Enemy" Doctrine:

> "We hired RobCo's own engineers. They built the UOS from the inside - we're tearing it down from the inside. Every 'feature' is an attack surface. Every 'convenience' is a vulnerability."

The team reverse-engineered RobCo UOS by:

1. Recruiting disgruntled RobCo employees
1. Analyzing seized Chinese cyber warfare tools
1. Exploiting the system's own diagnostic protocols
1. Creating a complete "shadow specification" of UOS architecture

## SIGNET - Signal Intelligence Network

### Overview
The **SIGNET** (Signal Intelligence Network) is the Enclave's classified internal network, established in 2074 as a secure communication and data sharing system for OMEGA clearance personnel. SIGNET provided the infrastructure for deploying and testing ECHELON prototypes before field deployment.

**Looking Glass Browser:** SIGNET's primary interface is the **Looking Glass** secure web browser, purpose-built for intelligence operations and terminal breach activities. Looking Glass provides a hardened, surveillance-resistant platform for accessing ECHELON tools over the network.

### Infrastructure

#### Physical Network
Fiber-optic connections between major Enclave facilities:

* **Raven Rock Mountain Complex (Site-R)** - Primary network hub
* **Poseidon Oil Rig** - Secondary hub (established 2242, post-war)
* **Control Station ENCLAVE** - West Coast coordination center
* **NEST** (National Emergency Strategic Terminal) - Intelligence coordination
* **Selected military installations** - Compartmentalized access nodes

#### Access Points

* Secure terminals at Enclave facilities (biometric authentication required)
* Pip-Boy 3000 Mark III/IV integration for field operatives (ECHELON era)
* **Looking Glass browser** (SIGNET's primary web interface)
* Emergency backup terminals (EMP-hardened)

### Security Features

* **Encryption:** 256-bit quantum-resistant end-to-end encryption
* **Authentication:** Multi-factor biometric (retinal scan + fingerprint + voice recognition)
* **Network Isolation:** Completely air-gapped from public networks and RobCo infrastructure
* **Physical Security:** EMP-hardened fiber-optic lines, redundant power systems
* **Intrusion Response:** Automatic data wipe on unauthorized access attempts
* **Monitoring:** Real-time network activity logging (OMEGA-7+ clearance review only)

### ECHELON Deployment on SIGNET

#### GHOST v1.0.0 - First SIGNET Deployment (September 2076)

The GHOST v1.0.0 prototype was the first ECHELON version deployed on SIGNET via the **Looking Glass** browser, allowing authorized personnel to access the terminal breach system without requiring a Pip-Boy.

**Deployment Rationale:**

* **Testing & Training:** Easier to test and refine algorithms on secure terminals
* **Centralized Updates:** Push updates to all SIGNET nodes simultaneously
* **Collaborative Development:** Multiple engineers could analyze breach attempts in real-time
* **Intelligence Sharing:** Access to shared databases of breached terminals and password patterns
* **No Hardware Dependency:** Eliminated Pip-Boy manufacturing bottlenecks during development

**SIGNET-Specific Features:**

* Looking Glass browser-based interface accessible from any authorized terminal
* Real-time collaboration on active breach attempts
* Centralized logging of all breach attempts for analysis
* Automatic synchronization with NEST intelligence databases
* Remote training modules for new operatives

#### GHOST v1.2.4 "Ghost Revised" - Standard SIGNET Build

GHOST v1.2.4 remained the standard SIGNET deployment through October 2077, providing:

* Neural pattern recognition algorithms
* Behavioral psychology-based word selection
* 81% success rate on Average difficulty terminals
* 8-minute average breach time

**Limitations:**

* Required physical presence at Enclave facilities (no field deployment)
* Dependent on SIGNET network uptime
* Lower performance than ECHELON field versions
* Not suitable for hostile environment operations

#### Deployment Strategy

The Enclave maintained a dual-deployment strategy:

* **SIGNET (GHOST v1.2.4 via Looking Glass):** For training, testing, and facility-based operations
* **Pip-Boy (ECHELON v2.1.7):** For field operatives requiring portable breach capability

##### Dr. Krane's Deployment Memo (September 2077):

> "SIGNET deployment of GHOST v1.2.4 via Looking Glass serves as our testing ground and fallback position. Every field operative with ECHELON v2.1.7 on Pip-Boy should have SIGNET access for intelligence updates and collaborative analysis. Think of GHOST as the 'home base' and ECHELON as the 'field kit' - both essential, different purposes."

### Post-War SIGNET Status

#### Survival

* **Raven Rock hub:** Fully operational (survived Great War in deep underground bunker)
* **Poseidon Oil Rig hub:** Established post-war (2242), became primary East Coast node
* **Regional nodes:** 67% survived with varying degrees of functionality
* **Fiber-optic infrastructure:** 40% intact, sufficient for critical operations

#### Modern Usage (2287)

SIGNET remains operational in surviving Enclave facilities:

* Intelligence sharing between scattered Enclave remnants
* Access to pre-war ECHELON documentation and training materials
* Coordination of terminal breach operations
* Repository of 50,000+ breached terminal passwords (pre-war database)

**GHOST v1.2.4 Looking Glass Access:** Still available on SIGNET for operatives who prefer browser-based interface or lack Pip-Boy access. Some post-war Enclave personnel exclusively use GHOST via Looking Glass on SIGNET terminals.

### Version History & Development Milestones

#### CODENAME: RAVEN (April-August 2076)
**Status:** Proof of Concept

* **v0.3.1** "Raven" - First successful UOS breach in controlled environment
  * Required 47 minutes to crack Average difficulty terminal
  * Success rate: 34%
  * Platform: Dedicated SIGINT console (180 lbs, not portable)
  * **Direct NX-12 Implementation:** Breach code hardwired to NX-12 terminal hardware
  * Critical Flaw: Easily detected by system logs

##### Internal Assessment:

> "RAVEN proves concept viability but remains tactically useless. We need portability and stealth."

##### The Abstraction Problem (June 2076):

Dr. Krane's team hit a critical roadblock when field intelligence identified newer RobCo terminal models (NX-20 with 16-color displays, NX-120 with pointing device support). The v0.3.1 codebase was tightly coupled to NX-12 hardware specifications - supporting new models would require complete rewrites.

> "We can't rewrite the entire breach engine every time RobCo releases a new terminal. We need an abstraction layer - something that preserves our core algorithms while adapting to whatever hardware RobCo throws at us. Otherwise, we're playing an endless game of catch-up."  
> - Dr. Elizabeth Krane, Technical Memo (June 15, 2076)

* **v0.4.0** "Raven Evolved" (September 2076) - **PHOSPHOR 1.0 introduced**
  * First hardware abstraction layer implementation
  * Breach time improved to 42 minutes (optimization during refactoring)
  * Success rate: 38%
  * Platform support: NX-12 (monochrome), NX-20 (monochrome mode)
  * **Critical Achievement:** Core breach algorithms preserved unchanged from v0.3.1
  * **PHOSPHOR Innovation:** Same codebase runs on multiple terminal types

##### Dr. Krane's PHOSPHOR Breakthrough (August 2076):

> "We reverse-engineered a RobCo CRT display unit and discovered something brilliant. The phosphor coating's decay rate creates timing artifacts that UOS uses for handshake verification. We're not just emulating the display - we're replicating it at the hardware level. That's why I'm calling it PHOSPHOR. It's not a terminal emulator. It's a universal interface layer."  
> - Dr. Elizabeth Krane, PHOSPHOR Technical Specification

#### CODENAME: GHOST (September 2076-January 2077)
**Status:** Field Prototype

* **v1.0.0** **"Ghost Protocol"** - First Pip-Boy integrated version
  * Breach time reduced to 8 minutes (Average terminals)
  * Success rate: 67%
  * Platform: Pip-Boy 2000 AND **Looking Glass** web browser (SIGNET deployment)
  * **PHOSPHOR 1.5:** Platform expansion beyond terminals - Pip-Boy and web browser support
  * Major Innovation: Stealth mode (no system log traces)
  * **Dual Deployment:** First version deployed on both Pip-Boy and SIGNET network
  * **Looking Glass Browser:** SIGNET's secure web browser for terminal breach operations

##### Platform Unification Strategy (September 2076):

> "PHOSPHOR 1.5 is a game-changer. We've achieved true platform independence - the same breach code runs on a 180-pound terminal, a wrist-mounted Pip-Boy, and the Looking Glass browser on SIGNET. The operator doesn't need to know which platform they're on. PHOSPHOR handles everything."  
> - Dr. Elizabeth Krane, Platform Architecture Review

* **v1.2.0** (October 2076) - **PHOSPHOR 2.0 milestone**
  * **16-color support** for NX-20 and NX-120 terminals
  * **Four color palettes:** Green Phosphor, Amber Phosphor, White Phosphor, Blue Phosphor
  * Each palette maintains 4 brightness levels (Background, Dark, Normal, Bright)
  * **Pointing device abstraction:** Native mouse/trackball support (NX-120)
  * **Virtual cursor system:** Arrow key navigation for NX-12/NX-20
  * **Backward compatibility:** NX-12 runs all palettes in monochrome (4 green shades)

##### Dr. Krane on Color Palette Strategy (October 1076):

> "Different operators prefer different aesthetics. Some want classic green CRT. Others prefer amber or white. PHOSPHOR 2.0 gives them choice while maintaining functional consistency. On an NX-12, every palette looks the same - four shades of green. On an NX-20, each palette has its own character. The interface adapts to the hardware without the operator changing their workflow."  
> - Dr. Elizabeth Krane, User Experience Memo

* **v1.2.4** **"Ghost Revised"** - Neural pattern recognition added
  * First use of behavioral psychology in word selection algorithms
  * Success rate improved to 81%
  * Platform: **Looking Glass** browser via SIGNET (standard deployment)
  * Field Test: Successfully breached Vault 92 backup terminals (Pip-Boy version)
  * **SIGNET Standard:** Became the permanent Looking Glass-based version for facility operations

##### Classified Field Report (November 2076):

> "Operative Delta-7 reports GHOST performed exceptionally during Vault-Tec inspection. No detection by facility staff. However, breach speed still inadequate for hot extractions."

##### SIGNET Deployment Assessment (January 2077):

> "GHOST v1.2.4 on SIGNET has proven invaluable for training and collaborative analysis. Recommend maintaining this version for facility-based operations while pursuing field-optimized ECHELON development for Pip-Boy deployment."
> - Dr. Elizabeth Krane

##### PHOSPHOR 2.0 Impact Assessment (December 2076):

> "The pointing device abstraction was controversial. Some argued we didn't need mouse support for a text-based breach tool. They were thinking too narrowly. PHOSPHOR 2.0 positions us for future capabilities we haven't even conceived yet. When ECHELON v3.0 eventually adds graphical analysis tools, the infrastructure will already be there."  
> - Dr. Elizabeth Krane, Forward Planning Document

#### CODENAME: ECHELON (February-October 2077)
**Status:** Operational Deployment

* **v2.0.0** **"Echelon"** - Complete system redesign
  * Breach time: 2-4 minutes (Average), 6-9 minutes (Very Hard)
  * Success rate: 94%
  * **PHOSPHOR 3.0:** Graphical capabilities added (Pip-Boy 3000 Mark III/IV and Looking Glass only)
  * **Pip-Boy 3000 Mark III/IV support:** First ECHELON versions compatible with Pip-Boy 3000 series
  * **Complete backward compatibility:** Runs on NX-12, NX-20, NX-120, Pip-Boy 2000, Pip-Boy 3000 series, and Looking Glass browser
  * **Platform feature matrix:** Graphics disabled on NX-series terminals (text mode fallback)
  * **Game-Changer:** Quantum decryption core (theoretical pre-war quantum computing)
  * Polymorphic API key melting (adaptive attack vectors)
  * Platform: Pip-Boy 3000 Mark III and Mark IV compatible

##### Dr. Krane's Technical Notes:

> "ECHELON doesn't crack passwords - it thinks like the person who created them. The neural pattern recognition module has achieved 94% accuracy in predicting human password selection behavior based on vocabulary analysis alone."

##### PHOSPHOR 3.0 Architecture Philosophy (February 2077):

> "PHOSPHOR 3.0 represents the culmination of our abstraction layer vision. We can now deploy graphical analysis tools on modern platforms while maintaining text-mode compatibility with every terminal in the field. An NX-12 from 2070 can run the same breach algorithms as a Pip-Boy Mark IV from 2077. Write once, deploy everywhere - across seven years of hardware evolution."  
> - Dr. Elizabeth Krane, PHOSPHOR 3.0 Technical Overview

##### Backward Compatibility Verification (March 2077):

> "We've successfully tested ECHELON v2.0.0 on every RobCo terminal variant from the NX-12 (2070) through the NX-120 (2076). The core breach algorithms written for RAVEN v0.3.1 in April 2076 still execute flawlessly. PHOSPHOR's abstraction layer has proven itself - no operator retraining required, no platform-specific patches needed."  
> - Testing Division Report, Site-R

* **v2.1.0** (May 2077) - Dictionary attack optimization
  * Reduced false positive rate by 23%
  * Added tactical breach scenarios database
  * Improved NEST mainframe synchronization
  * **PHOSPHOR 3.0 refinement:** Optimized phosphor decay timing algorithms

* **v2.1.5** (August 2077) - Enhanced neural pattern recognition
  * Incorporated data from 50,000+ breached terminals
  * Machine learning refinements
  * First "zero-attempt" breaches (correct password on first try: 12% of cases)
  * **PHOSPHOR enhancement:** Hardware-level handshake timing replication

##### Phosphor Timing Breakthrough (August 2077):

> "We discovered that RobCo's 'secure' terminals perform authentication handshakes by measuring display response times down to the microsecond. They thought nobody could replicate the exact phosphor decay curves of their CRT displays. They were wrong. PHOSPHOR 3.0 defeats this by being physically identical to genuine RobCo displays at the hardware timing level."  
> - Dr. Elizabeth Krane, Security Analysis Memo

* **v2.1.6** (September 2077) - Counter-intrusion hardening
  * Added honeypot countermeasures (defense against reverse-hacking)
  * Improved stealth protocol handlers
  * Emergency data wipe functionality

* **v2.1.7** (October 2077) - Final pre-war version
  * Optimized dictionary attack vectors
  * Improved stealth mode (undetectable even by military-grade intrusion detection)
  * Enhanced EMP buffer protection
  * **PHOSPHOR 3.0 finalized:** Perfect backward compatibility verified
  * **Status:** 247 units deployed to OMEGA clearance operatives

##### Final Security Assessment (October 19, 2077):

> "ECHELON represents the most sophisticated signals intelligence tool in the Enclave's arsenal. Recommendation: Expand deployment to all continuity-of-government personnel before year-end."

##### Dr. Krane's Final Report on PHOSPHOR (October 20, 2077):

> "Three iterations of PHOSPHOR - from the basic abstraction layer in RAVEN v0.4.0 to the universal platform in ECHELON v2.1.7. We've achieved something unprecedented: a single codebase that runs on hardware spanning seven years of evolution, from monochrome terminals to graphical Pip-Boys. Future Enclave operatives will benefit from this architecture for decades, perhaps centuries. PHOSPHOR isn't just technology - it's insurance against obsolescence."  
> - Dr. Elizabeth Krane, ECHELON Final Documentation

## Post-War Legacy
### October 23, 2077 - The Great War
When the bombs fell, ECHELON became invaluable:

* **204 of 247 units survived** (stored in EMP-shielded Pip-Boys)
* Critical for accessing pre-war military installations
* Enabled Enclave to breach Vault-Tec systems
* Allowed control of automated defense networks

### The Charleston Tragedy (Winter 2077-2078)

Dr. Elizabeth Krane perished during the Charleston Starvation, one of the darkest chapters of the immediate post-war period. Official Enclave records cite "resource allocation failure" as the cause of death.

**Conspiracy Theory:**

Some within the Enclave believe Robert House, having survived the Great War in his fortified Lucky 38 tower, orchestrated Krane's disappearance. House had opposed government oversight of RobCo operations before the war - eliminating the architect of ECHELON would be strategic revenge. The theory gained traction when analysis revealed Charleston's supply routes were mysteriously rerouted during the critical period.

**Official Statement (February 2078):**

> "Dr. Krane's contributions to continuity-of-government operations cannot be overstated. Her loss diminishes us all. ECHELON development will continue under new leadership to honor her legacy."  
> - Colonel Augustus Autumn Sr., Enclave Command

**Project Leadership Transition:**

Dr. Marcus Aldridge, Krane's chief deputy during PHOSPHOR 3.0 development, assumed project leadership in March 2078. Aldridge had been instrumental in the PHOSPHOR abstraction layer's implementation and maintained deep institutional knowledge of the system's architecture.

##### Dr. Aldridge's First Directive (March 2078):

> "Dr. Krane built ECHELON to be immortal - a system that would outlive its creators. My job is to prove her right. We preserve what works, we adapt what must change, and we never forget why she built this: so the Enclave survives, no matter what."  
> - Dr. Marcus Aldridge, ECHELON Project Director

### PHOSPHOR's Post-War Advantage

The decision to build PHOSPHOR as a universal abstraction layer proved prescient in the post-war wasteland:

#### Terminal Compatibility (Post-War Assessment, 2080):

> "We're encountering terminal variants we never anticipated: Brotherhood of Steel reverse-engineered models, heavily modified Institute systems, degraded pre-war installations running on backup power. PHOSPHOR's abstraction layer handles them all. Dr. Krane's architecture decision saved us from writing custom breach code for every wasteland terminal variant."  
> - Dr. Marcus Aldridge, ECHELON Technical Division

#### Platform Diversity (200 Years Later):

* **Brotherhood of Steel terminals:** Compatible (reverse-engineered from RobCo NX-series)
* **Institute terminals:** Partially compatible (heavily modified but UOS-derived)
* **Pre-war military installations:** Full compatibility (various NX vintages)
* **Vault-Tec systems:** Full compatibility (NX-series based)
* **Degraded terminals:** PHOSPHOR adapts to reduced capabilities
* **Scavenged displays:** Works with mixed hardware configurations

### Continued Development (Post-War)
The system continued evolving in Raven Rock and later on the Poseidon Oil Rig under Dr. Aldridge's leadership:

* **v2.2.x series** (2080s): Adapted for degraded pre-war terminals
  * PHOSPHOR enhancements for damaged CRT displays
  * Voltage fluctuation compensation
  * Degraded phosphor coating adaptation

##### Dr. Aldridge on Wasteland Adaptation (2082):

> "Dr. Krane designed PHOSPHOR for pristine pre-war hardware. The wasteland gave us melted displays, failing power supplies, and radiation-damaged circuits. We're teaching PHOSPHOR to work with what survived, not what we wish had survived."  
> - Dr. Marcus Aldridge, Technical Adaptation Report

* **v2.2.5** (2085): **Power Armor Integration - Project IRONCLAD**
  * ECHELON integrated into T-60 Power Armor HUD systems
  * Allows operatives to breach terminals while maintaining combat readiness
  * Standard deployment to all Enclave Power Armor units by 2090

##### Dr. Aldridge on IRONCLAD (2085):

> "The armor doesn't make the operator safer. ECHELON makes the operator faster. Speed is safety."  
> - Dr. Marcus Aldridge, IRONCLAD Project Summary

**Brotherhood Captured Units:**

When the Brotherhood of Steel began capturing Enclave T-60 units with integrated ECHELON, the security risk became apparent. Brotherhood Scribes attempted reverse-engineering but were blocked by OMEGA-7 biometric locks. However, the mere presence of ECHELON in captured armor compromised operational security.

**Security Response (2150s):**

ECHELON integration was removed from standard Power Armor configurations. By the X-series Advanced Power Armor era, ECHELON remained exclusive to Hellfire-class units only - reserved for elite operatives whose armor was unlikely to be captured.

* **v2.3.x series** (2150s): Brotherhood of Steel detection countermeasures
  * PHOSPHOR signature masking (prevents BoS detection of Enclave tools)
  * Power Armor integration limited to Hellfire-class units

* **v2.4.x series** (2240s): Institute technology analysis integration
  * PHOSPHOR extended to handle Institute hybrid terminal systems

### Modern Status (2287)
ECHELON v2.1.7 remains the "gold standard" build:

* Most stable version
* Fully compatible with all pre-war terminal types
* No authentication servers required (all algorithms local)
* Perfect preservation of Dr. Krane's original architecture
* **PHOSPHOR 3.0 unchanged:** Still the definitive abstraction layer

##### Why v2.1.7 Endures:

> "Later versions added features we don't need and complexity we can't maintain. v2.1.7 is elegant, proven, and deadly. When you're breaching a terminal in hostile territory with super mutants breathing down your neck, you want the version that's worked flawlessly for 210 years."
> - Colonel Autumn, Enclave Intelligence Division

##### PHOSPHOR's 210-Year Legacy (2287):

> "Dr. Krane's PHOSPHOR abstraction layer has outlived her by two centuries. Every terminal we encounter - from pristine Vault-Tec systems to jury-rigged Brotherhood salvage - PHOSPHOR handles it. We're still using code she wrote in 2076. That's not just good engineering. That's immortality. Dr. Aldridge spent his career preserving her vision. We honor them both by keeping ECHELON v2.1.7 alive."  
> - Enclave Archivist, Historical Technology Preservation Division


## Technical Philosophy
### "The UOS Was Designed to Be Breached"
Dr. Krane's controversial theory:
#### Core Vulnerabilities by Design:

1. **Password Display:** Showing "x/y correct" feedback is cryptographically insane
1. **Bracket Utilities:** The dud-removal system was a maintenance backdoor that became standard
1. **Attempt Limits:** Four attempts with reset capability was commercial convenience over security
1. **Predictable Word Lists:** RobCo used constrained dictionaries for user-friendliness

#### The Conspiracy Theory:
Some Enclave analysts believe RobCo intentionally weakened UOS security at government request, creating a backdoor for intelligence agencies. ECHELON doesn't exploit flaws - it exploits intentional features.

##### Dr. Krane's Final Report (October 2077):

> "We didn't break RobCo's security. We just read the manual they were afraid to publish."
