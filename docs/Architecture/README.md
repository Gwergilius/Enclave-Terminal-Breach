# Architecture Documentation

**English** | [Magyar]

Technical architecture, design decisions, and system specifications.

## Solution Architecture

- [Project Structure] - Layer definitions, dependency rules, and reference matrix for all projects

## Core Documents

- [Algorithm] - Password elimination algorithm specification
- [Solver Comparison] - Comparison of solver strategies
- [State Machine] - Application state management design
- [Future Architecture] - Planned optimizations and patterns

## Platform Requirements

- [SPARROW Requirements] - Business and technical requirements for the SPARROW (console POC) release
- [RAVEN Requirements] - Business and technical requirements for the RAVEN (enhanced console) release

## Release Specifications

- [RAVEN 2.0.0 Specification] - Detailed implementation spec for the RAVEN 2.0.0 release

## Subsystem Requirements

- [PHOSPHOR Requirements] - PHOSPHOR console UI abstraction layer (versions 1.0–1.2)

## Platform Services

- [Platform Services Summary] - Cross-platform service abstractions
- [Configuration Infrastructure] - Configuration system architecture

## Design Decisions

- [ColorValue Design] - Color palette implementation choices

## Purpose

These documents provide:
- Technical foundation for all implementation phases
- Architectural patterns and best practices
- Design rationale and trade-offs
- Cross-platform compatibility strategies
