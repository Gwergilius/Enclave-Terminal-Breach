# Architecture Documentation

Technical architecture, design decisions, and system specifications.

## Core Documents

- [Algorithm] - Password elimination algorithm specification
- [State Machine] - Application state management design
- [Future Architecture] - Planned optimizations and patterns

## Platform Services

- [Platform Services Summary] - Cross-platform service abstractions
- [Configuration Infrastructure] - Configuration system architecture

## Design Decisions

- [ColorValue Design] - Color palette implementation choices
- [Boot Sequence Architecture] - Event-driven boot sequence design
- [PHOSPHOR Abstraction] - Terminal abstraction layer (from lore)

## Purpose

These documents provide:
- Technical foundation for all implementation phases
- Architectural patterns and best practices
- Design rationale and trade-offs
- Cross-platform compatibility strategies
