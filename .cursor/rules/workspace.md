# Workspace Structure

## Workspace Location

We are using the `V:\` folder as a workspace (root folder). During the communication, the folder references starting with '~' character refers to this folder. 

For example, when I refers to the `~/docs` folder, that means the `V:\docs` folder.

## Git Commit Policy

**CRITICAL: NEVER commit changes automatically. All commits must be done manually by the user.**

- Do NOT use git commit, git add, or any git commands that modify the repository
- Do NOT stage files for commit unless explicitly requested
- The user will handle all git operations manually
- You may prepare commit messages or show git status, but never execute commits
